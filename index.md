**Blueprint Africa** is a group of volunteers and retired IT workers who have come together to help vulnerable people in the Global South protect themselves from scams and cybercriminals.

Every year hundreds of millions of dollars are lost to online fraud and the problem is growing year on year. This represents a significant drag on business and economic development. 

In 2020, the Cybersecurity Exposure Index ranked Africa as [the continent with the highest exposure to cybercrime globally](https://passwordmanagers.co/cybersecurity-exposure-index/#global). Several countries in the region still lack dedicated cybercrime legislation. 

There are **effective countermeasures** you can take to minimise the impact of online crime. We can get a volunteer to teach you security skills in a free informal meeting to show you how to protect yourself.

If you would like us to organise a training session, please get in touch, by post or email:
